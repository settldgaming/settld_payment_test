# Settld Test

This project is a minimal front-end for tracking crypto deposits with Settld.

## Deploying to Vercel

The included `vercel.json` config serves the `public` directory as a static site. After installing the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli), you can deploy with:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Configuration

The page loads `/config.js` to determine API settings. On Vercel this file is
generated by a serverless function exposing the following environment
variables:

- `SETTLD_API_BASE_URL` – base URL of the Settld API
- `SETTLD_ETHERSCAN_TX_URL` (optional) – base URL for viewing transactions
  on a block explorer

Set these variables in your Vercel project so the client can build the correct
request URLs.

## Countdown

When a deposit request is created, a QR code and payment link are shown. A countdown starts at 300 seconds to match Vercel's serverless function time limit. If time expires before the deposit is received, the request is cancelled.
